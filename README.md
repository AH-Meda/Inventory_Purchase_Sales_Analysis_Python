<h1 align="center"> ✨`Inventory, Purchase, and Sales Analysis and Optimization: A Comprehensive Data Analysis Project`✨ </h1>

**Project Summary**

This project aims to enhance inventory management practices for Bibitor, LLC, a retail wine and spirits company operating across multiple locations. WBibitor, LLC manages sales and cost of goods sold that reach into the hundreds of millions, rendering traditional spreadsheets insufficient. The vast volume of data, which includes millions of sales, purchase, and inventory records, requires a sophisticated approach for effective analysis. the goal of this project is to leverage extensive data analysis to optimize inventory control and extract valuable insights from the company's operation, particularly sales and purchases.The project tasks are divided into two main objectives:

- Analyze the inventory management process and provide recommendations for optimization.
- Extract meaningful business insights from the data and provide actionable recommendations.

Project Tasks Overview:

**`Part I: Explatonary Data Analysis, Cleaning and Preprocessing`**
The company provided six business operation datasets for the year ending 2016. The dataset includes:

- Beginning inventory for 2016
- Ending inventory for 2016
- Purchase invoices for 2016
- Purchase Price
- Sales data

These datasets are available on Kaggle and here is the url of the datasets for convinience https://www.kaggle.com/code/bahadir23/inventory-optimization-and-sustainability-analysis. Given the volume of data, there may be instances where the data is messy and inconsistent. It needs to be explored, cleaned, assessed, with key trends and inconsistencies identified. In this part, we:

- `Explore the data`: Load the data and get an overview. Identify any irregularities.
- `Clean and Preprocess the data`
  - `Identify and handle missing values and duplicates`
  - `Standardize or remove inconsistencies and erroneous entries`
  - `Identify outliers or anomalous data`
  - `Merge related tables for easier handling and processing`

`Part II and Part III ---> EXplanotory Data Analysis and Visualization`

**`Part II: Inventory Analysis and Optimization`**

- Conduct an Inventory Control Analysis based on parameters such as Lead Time (LT), Safety Stock, Reorder Point, and ABC Analysis.
- Extract meaningful business insights related to inventory by answering the following questions:

  1.  Which products have high inventory counts at the end of the inventory period, and do they fall into Class A in ABC inventory analysis?
  2.  Which products have low inventory counts at the end of the inventory period, did they register any sales in the previous year, and do they fall into Class C in ABC inventory analysis?
  3.  Identify products with large inventories but low annual sales, and conversely, use the ratio of annual sales to ending inventory for this analysis.
  4.  Do products with larger safety stocks record higher sales volumes, and to which category in ABC Analysis do they belong?
  5.  List the top 10 products that require immediate reordering along with their reorder quantities.
  6.  Determine each category's contribution to total revenue based on the ABC inventory analysis.
  7.  Identify the top 10 products from each category that contribute most to the annual total revenue.
  8.  Identify the top 10 products from each category that contribute least to the annual total revenue.

**`Part III: Extracting Meaningfull insight for Purchase and Sales`**

Extract meaningful business insights related to purchase and sales by answering the following questions:
- Who are the the important vendors or supplier. Evaluate based on quantities of items supplied, values of the items and contirbution of the items to total revenue of the company. bottom vendors interms of quantity and value of supplies
- Who are the the least important vendors or supplier. Evaluate based on quantities of items supplied, values of the items and contirbution of the items to total revenue of the company. bottom vendors interms of quantity and value of supplies
- What is the average payment execution period for each vendor and how does it correlate with the purchase quantity or purchase value?
- Which products sell the most in terms of quantity and dollar sales amount, and conversely, which ones sell the least?
- How does the sales performance of different stores compare, and which are the top 10 stores with the highest sales output?
- Which product size sells the most?
- Can we project and identify the sales trends throughout the year?

**Conclusion:**  
The insights derived from these analyses will provide recommendations for managing inventory and other business operation in a more efficient and sustainable manner.
